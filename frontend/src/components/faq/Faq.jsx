                        Each team start with a budget to buy their team. Teams take turns putting players on the
                        block, a bidding frenzy ensues and when the timer expires, the team with the highest bid wins
                        the player! The process continues until all teams are full.

                        Snake drafts are great, but the lucky player that draws the 1st pick has exclusive access to
                        the best player! Auction drafts overcome this problem, whilst also introducing a lot of
                        additional strategy. There's nothing quite like the thrill of a bidding war!

                        Firstly, you need to register/login (it's quick/easy/free), then navigate to
                        "Create Draft" to create your first auction-draft. Once done,
                        invite league-members by sharing your Draft ID and enter the Draft Room
                        by clicking "Open" on the "My Drafts" page.

                    <Typography gutterBottom variant="h6" color="textSecondary" align={"left"}>
                        All you need is the draft's unique ID (your Commission has this on their
                        "My Drafts" page), then simply register/login, click
                        "Join Draft" and enter your Draft ID. The Draft will then appear on your "My Drafts" page.

                        Unfortunately not! SuperDraft is not designed for running your league, it is
                        a platform for drafting your teams via an auction-draft. You will still need to run
                        your league via a standard fantasy football app.

                        I've drafted my team, I had so much fun, now how do I get my team in my fantasy football app?

                    <Typography gutterBottom variant="h6" color="textSecondary" align={"left"}>
                        A great and important question! Unfortunately, SuperDraft does not currently interface
                        with the Australian Rules fantasy football apps. Thus, one poor
                        league member (I suggest the wooden-spooner) must manually enter teams from
                        SuperDraft into your fantasy football app. The best way is via a "One-Computer Snake Draft".
